# fastLEDpy
There are great library for arduino fastLED - https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED
This library allow easily control addressable leds.

I wuold like to have such posibility to control led with RaspberyPy. For this purpose i will use python language. 
So, i will try to rewrite main maths/controls functions in Python.
